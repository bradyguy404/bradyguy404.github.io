          <em><strong>The Ace of Spades</strong></em>
          <hr>
          A 3D printed replica of the Ace of Spades hand cannon from the game <em>Destiny 2</em>. This weapon replica does not fire a projectile though
          the trigger does rotate the cylinder exactly 60º as if chambering another one of the 6 shots within the cylinder. When the
          trigger is fully pulled back the hammer will release as if firing a round. The wielder may also fire the weapon by cocking the hammer which
          rotates the cylinder and sets the hammer to be released upon a successful full trigger pull. Additionally, the weapon's cylinder will glow a
          faint bluish light when a certain ammo cell is inserted within the cylinder.

          A 3D printed replica of the Master Sword from <em>Legend of the Zelda</em>. This particular replica of the Master Sword is modeled after
          its appearance within the game <em>Breath of the Wild</em>. The replica has been slightly modifed from its original appearance within the
          game. The blade has been thinned down and the grip us more cylindrical to ensure the blade is in-line with where the wielder desires.
          The sword is technically classified as a longsword with a blade length of 38 inches and the wings of the guard spanning 12 inches.
