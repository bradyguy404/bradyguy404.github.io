        <span class="tab"></span>The Ace of Spades handcannon is a revolver style weapon from the game <em>Destiny</em> franchise. The weapon's
        6 shot cylinder rotates for each successful trigger pull. The weapon is seen firing as both a dual action revolver (the trigger moves the hammer
        back and rotates the cylinder) as well as single action (the hammer is cocked before firing by pulling the trigger). The weapon's cylinder can
        also be rotated out of place to eject and load new ammo cells. Another notable trait of the weapon is Memento Mori which is where the cylinder
        glows bluish/white when reloading after a kill. With all this functionality in mind I came up with an initial list of functionality I wanted my
        replica to accomplish.
        <ol>
          The weapon should...
          <li>have a safety mechanism as all weapons do to prevent the weapon from firing accidentally.</li>
          <li>be able to be fired in single action with the hammer being manually cocked back.</li>
          <li>be able to be fired in double action where the hammer and cylinder move with the trigger pull.</li>
          <li>have a cylinder that can rotate away form the barrel to allow for the loading of ammo cells.</li>
          <li>light up a bluish/white when a certain type of ammo cell is loaded into the cylinder.</li>
        </ol>
        <span class="tab"></span>The functionality of the gun as both a double action and a single action revolver is perhaps the most complicated
        functionality of the replica. Basically the hammer needs to move with a trigger pull (double action) but the trigger does not move when the
        hammer pulls (single action). Additionally the hammer should lock in place after being pulled a certain distance. When the trigger is pulled
        far back enough the hammer should then be released and return to its original position. Since the hammer always moves when preparing to fire
        the blaster, we can exploit this by creating a "block" that prevents the hammer from rotating while the safety is engaged. Additionally, the
        hammer should be responsible for the cylinder rotating and when the cylinder has turned a full 60ยบ the cylinder needs to be "caught" and prevent
        it from rotating. A pawl and gear system will also be used to prevent the cylinder from rotating counter clockwise.
        <br><br>
        <span class="tab"></span>The cylinder and its ability to rotate out of the gun poses some of the biggest problems with the project. To begin
        with, the connection that holds the cylinder to the gun actually clips (moves through a solid) part of the gun when reloading. To fix this, the
        connection will extend further into the base of the gun to increase the radius of rotation. The glowing cylinder means that the cylinder needs
        to be mostly translucent (see though) in order for light to pass through. The ammo cell that is inserted into the cylinder will actually host
        the lights and batteries to power them.

      <!-- Modeling -->

        <hr>
        <span class="tab"></span>The Ace of Spades proved to be a challenge when it came to modeling the replica. Its actually a model that I started in
        Autodesk Inventor before I switched to Solidworks as my primary CAD software. The body and shell was fairly easy but just required a lot of
        measuring the model in game and then converting that to its scaled up measurements. The most difficult part of the body was the grip of the gun
        which has a lot of complex geometry that a software like Solidworks can't really model accurately. For the grip, I ended up using my knowledge
        of Blender to model the grip and then add it the rest of the Solidworks model.
        <br><br>
        <span class="tab"></span>The most complicated part of the process was modeling and designing the actual inner functionality of the weapon. The
        main issue stems from the location of the hammer. Unlike most revolvers which have a lower axis of rotation for the hammer, this gun's hammer's
        rotational axis is much higher up. This lead to some major changes from most standard revolvers and resulted in me using a gear as well as a rack
        and pinion to aid in the trigger-hammer system.

        <center><em><strong>Prototyping</em></strong></center>
        <hr>
        <span class="tab"></span>The first print of the Ace of Spades was a very rough model that I mainly used to judge the scale of the weapon and
        to ensure that the weapon was feasible to print. With the first prototype done, I then finished the detailing on the body of the gun and
        finished all the aesthetic parts of the model. From there came the difficult process of modeling the complex inner workings of the weapon. My
        first iterations seemed promising and worked well within the Solidworks assembly but after printing these parts I noticed some flaws. Since the
        parts were 3D printed the durability of some of the thinner parts allowed for bending and in some case cracking. This meant that these intricate
        mechanical parts were not functioning as intended leading to a "poor" (not working in the slightest) hammer-trigger mechansim.
        <br><br>
        <span class="tab"></span>After several iterations I eventually had to switch to 2 mm metal rods as axles for several gears, the hammer, and for
        the trigger. <strong>INSERT DESCRIPTION OF MECHANISM</strong>. With the mechanism now working it was just time to assemble the pieces together
        and add the finishing touches.
