			<em><strong>Planning</strong></em>

		<hr>
		<span class="tab"></span>One of my earliest projects was the idea of
		making something capable of melting down aluminum and various other
		metals. As I researched some of the best methods of doing this I
		stumbled across the designs and guides of a youtuber named <em>The
			King of Random</em>. After looking at his homemade foundry I decided that
		my design would be similar to his. The main differences would be that
		while he implored a charcoal method for heating the forge I would use
		a propane torch. With this in mind I decided to make the insulated
		walls out of a sand and plaster of paris mix all contained within a
		large steel trashcan. The lid would also be made using this mixture
		and will be cast in a donut shape to allow for air to flow out as well
		as metal to be inserted into the foundry. I also planned on using a
		clay-graphite crucible to actually hold the molten metal. <br> <br>

			<em><strong>Prototyping</strong></em>
		</div>
		<hr>
		<span class="tab"></span>After successfully constructing an initial
		foundry out of a sand and plaster of paris mix I discovered several
		flaws with the design. The greatest weakness with the design was the
		durability of the lid and insulation. The foundry walls constantly
		cracked and the lid itself would constantly need to be recast due to
		it breaking from the heat. The foundry successfully melted the metal I
		desired but the durabilty of the foundry was less than desirable.
		Additionally the large opening allowed for the forge to have air to
		run but allowed for a lot of heat to escape. Overall it was a good
		prototype, but not something I would use in the long haul. <br> <br>
		<span class="tab"></span>The main issue with the foundry was the
		durability caused by the plaster of paris and sand mixture. A new
		foundry would need to use a different form of insulation in order to
		maintain a desirable durability. With some research I decided that a
		new foundry would utilize kale wool as the primary insulation. The
		interior of the foundry would also have a line of firebricks to help
		heep the crucible stable and allow for spilled molten metal to not mix
		with the kale wool. The lid of the foundry would be the lid of a
		trashcan also lined with kale wool and two small holes for air to
		enter/exit the foundry. <br> <br>

		<hr>
		<span class="tab"></span>The new metal foundry turned out great and
		held up well with time. The new lid allowed for the foundry to heat up
		much quicker and has not needed to be remade at all unlike the
		previous iteration. Overall I am very happy with how the foundry
		turned out. Should this version ever need to be remade I would likely
		used satanite as an insulation material instead of kale wool. This
		material is far stronger and is rigid meaning that a new foundry
		wouldn't require fire bricks at all. This would allow for a highly
		durable and safer foundry than the one that I am currently using. <br>
