        <span class="tab"></span>The Gobblegum machine is a machine that can be interacted with within the game <em> Call of Duty: Black
        Ops III</em> and dispenses a random gumball or "gobblegum" for the player. When interacted with the machine lights flash and the dome lights up
        with electricity before dispensing a gumball from the lion's mouth. When a gumball is dispensed the lights change color to match the color
        of the gumball. With these things in mind I decided to came up with a basic list of functions I wanted this machine to accomplish.
        <ol>
          The machine should...
          <li>have "dancing" lights when idle.</li>
          <li>be able to accept nickels to start the gumball dispensing process.</li>
          <li>successfully dispense a gumball through the lion's mouth on the top of the machine.</li>
          <li>have the glass ball flash blue and have the side lights flash when dispensing a gumball.</li>
          <li>have the side lights flash and change color to match one of the 4 basic gumball colors (green, blue, purple, orange).</li>
        </ol>
        <span class="tab"></span>With this in mind there are several mechanisms and electronics that will have to function togther in order for the
        machine to operate as intended. Each of the lights should have 4 colors to match the gumball colors. There should also be some kind of
        mechanical mechanism to ensure that only nickels are accepted by the mechanism. In order to actually dispense the gumball a clear tube will need
        to allow for a vertical transference to the lion's head. Finally, a device should recognize the color of the gumball dispensed and send a signal to
        the lights to change to that color.
