		<span class="tab"></span>The Master Sword is a one handed longsword
		from the game <em>Legend of Zelda, Breath of the Wild</em>. By
		measuring the dimensions of the blade in game and the measurements of
		a character holding it we can find the real world dimensions. By
		measuring these values I determined the blade to have a length of 38
		inches and the wings of the guard to span 12 inches. A couple of
		notable modifications that I decided to make to the sword was to thin
		down the blade from its original thickness in the game to a much more
		reasonable thickness. I also wanted the sword to have a more
		cylindrical grip instead of its normal perfectly circular one. This is
		so that the wielder of the blade can actually "hold zero" or keep the
		blade in line with where they are slashing. A cylindrical grip allows
		the wielder to essentially always hold the grip and by extension the
		sword the same way.
		<ol>
			The weapon should...
			<li>have a cylindrical grip for holding zero.</li>
			<li>have a blade length of 38 inches.</li>
			<li>be able to be swung around with the ease of a normal sword.</li>
		</ol>

		<hr>
		<span class="tab"></span>The Master Sword's blade was fairly straight
		forward to model in Solidwords due to its simple shape. The most
		complicated part of the project was making the hilt of the sword due
		to some of its complex geometry. Thankfully after several "Zero
		thickness Geometry" errors I was able to successfully shape the hilt
		with only some minor changes to its original appearance. The main
		difference of the sword is that the width of the wings and the blade
		have been thinned down. <br> <br>

		<hr>
		<span class="tab"></span>With the modeling completed the sword was
		ready to be 3D printed. After printing the blade as multiple pieces
		since the sword itself is too big to be printed as one piece it was
		time for the assembly. Assembling the blade unfortunatly led to an
		unfortunate result. While the blade looked great the inconsistent
		structure and the use of multiple parts made the blade very unstable,
		especially when swinging it. After sanding and priming it was clear
		that the 3D printed version of this blade would be much too unstable
		to be used. So where did this leave me? <br>
		<br> <span class="tab"></span>With 3D printing not holding up as
		to the desired standards due to the thickness of the blade I had to
		turn to an alterior method for fabricating the blade. In this case, I
		decided to use the already 3D printed blade and cast the blade using
		resin. To do this I made some silicone molds out of the 3D printed
		blade. From here it was just a process of casting the blade to get the
		structure of the sword. From there I could then move to the finishing
		process for the blade. <br> <br>
