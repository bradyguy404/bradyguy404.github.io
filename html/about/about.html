			<em><strong>Luke Brady</strong></em>

		<hr>
		<span class="tab"></span>My name is Luke Brady. I am a Junior at North
		Carolina State University. Currently, I am pursuing a Bachelor of
		Science degree in Mechanical Engineering and a minor in Computer
		Programming. My passion is achieving the impossible from replicas of
		my favorite games or movies or futuristic technologies. I believe in
		achieving this goal through the application of my acquired skills in
		computer programming or through my affinity for physical machines and
		mechanisms. <br>
		<br> <span class="tab"></span>I am searching for internship
		opportunities for the summer of 2023 as I continue to pursue my
		degree. I am currently intending to graduate in May 2024. In the
		meantime, I aim to learn new programming languages as well as increase
		my proficiency in the languages I have already learned. Additionally,
		I plan to continue making new replicas and integrate my affinity for
		robotics into future projects. This includes a working R2-D2 astromech
		droid. As I continue to work on and develop new projects, you can find
		them added to this website.
