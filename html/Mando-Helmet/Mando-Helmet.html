			Wars</em> are the helmets from various characters. One of these many
		iconic helmets is that of the Mandalorian bounty hunter turned
		reluctant father figure Dinn Djarin. The helmet is a shiny chrome
		color complete with a built in flashlight and a tinted visor. This
		particular project is one that I selected as the geometry of the
		helmet is something that I have not really had to model in the past
		and thus thought it would be good practice for these more complex
		geometries. I also figured the helmet should have a flashlight that
		can be manually turned on just like it does in the show <em>The
			Mandalorian</em>. I would also try and match the color and have a
		transparent tinted visor that the wearer can see through but someone
		looking at the helmet wouldn't be able to see through. <br> <br>
