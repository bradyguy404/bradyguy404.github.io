        <span class="tab"></span>Unlike most of my engineering projects this Chef's knife was something that I chose to artistically "free hand" it.
        I took a took a scrap of steel that I figured I could draw out (make longer and narrower) to a desired length of around 10 inches with a
        thickness of <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> inches. After forging out the metal to be this length and thickness it was a matter of shaping the
        blade and creating the tang for the handle. With some hammering by hand I was able to get a nice curve for the blade. The tang was a little
        harder to shape due to the thickness of the blade but with some careful work I was able to get a rough shape of what I wanted for the blade as
        you can see below.

        <span class="tab"></span>With the shape of the blade forged out it was time to go to the grinder and smooth out the edges. After smoothing out
        the edges and creating the first set of bevels (the slant) of the blade it was time to heat treat and temper the blade. After this process the
        blade was hardened and was ready for its finish and handle. For the finish the blade was left to sit in acid in order to etch (darken) the blade.
        After successfully etching the blade the next step was to stone wash the blade by putting it in a bucket of rocks and oil and shaking it to
        create what are essentially small scratches in the etch. With all this done it was a matter of using epoxy to attach the handle and then sharpen
        the blade. I made the wooden handle by attaching two pieces of wood to the tang of the blade and then shaping these pieces at the grinder to form
        a nice grip. Finally, with the blade ready I was able to sharpen the blade and produce chef's knife seen below.
